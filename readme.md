# BeCreate Battery Spectroscopy report

This repository contains the report for the BeCreative 2023-24 Battery Spectroscopy conducted at Fontys Hogeschool Engineering. Measurement setups, data and other technical content is not included in this repository.

## How to run

As the data used for plotting in the notebook isn't included in this repository, the path to a local copy of the data needs to be given. This is done by creating a file `project_dir_path.txt` and adding the path to the local project directory in this file. This path needs to be appended with a '/' character. An example path is given below:

`C:/Users/fercl/OneDrive - Office 365 Fontys/Be Creative 2023-2024 Battery Spectroscopy/`
